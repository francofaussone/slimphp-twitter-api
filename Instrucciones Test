Hi Franco,

I send you below the test that I mentioned in the call. The idea of ​​this test is to know your abilities to solve problems, and if they fit with the ones we require for the position and in the work team.

You will see that it is not difficult, and that the fundamental idea is that you can express all your knowledge and skills as a developer. 

Deadline: 20/07

Build an endpoint that returns an array with the last 10 tweets of a twitter account, respecting the following format: 
 
{
	"created_at": "Mon Jun 25 16:03:38 +0000 2018",
	"text": "esto es un tweet",
	"in_reply": {
		"id": 123465,
		"name": "john doe"
	}
}

Parametros:

created_at : obligatorio
text: obligatorio
in_reply: si fuese una respuesta a otro usuario.

Conditions
The project should be developed using PHP 5.4+
If necessary, you can use any web framework of your choice, We recommend SlimPHP
You can use the data store solution of your choice if you need one
The full project should be correctly revisioned using GIT. That GIT repository should be accesible by us (publicly or privately) on GitHub or BitBucket.
You don't need to serve the project to the internet but it should be testeable locally using the php built-in webserver or similar solution with the proper documentation on how to do it
Unit Tests are a big plus!
All added value you can give to the original idea is highly appreciated
Have Fun!

Thank you, good luck.
